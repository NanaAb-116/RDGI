            The Clinical Research Network for Undiagnosed and Rare Diseases is a
            professional network under Rare Disease Ghana Initiative that seeks
            to create a clear structure for knowledge sharing and care
            coordination among health professionals and researchers across
            Ghana. They are networks of expertise, healthcare providers and
            researchers focused on genetic and rare diseases that are organized
            across Ghana. <br />
            Since no centre of expertise exists for a specific rare disease in
            Ghana, patients can still benefit from the knowledge that their
            medical professionals can get from other specialists in other
            facilities. CRN-URD provide the structure that facilitates a
            healthcare provider's ability to access such knowledge across
            geographical regions. <br />
            CRN-URD promote the sharing and mobility of expertise, rather than
            the movement of patients themselves across the country.
            Dissemination of knowledge through the Clinical Research Network for
            Undiagnosed and Rare Diseases could also help to establish shared
            information databases and in turn support the development of best
            practice protocols. This could contribute to the 'levelling up' of
            the expertise of healthcare professionals, who can benefit from the
            experience of their counterparts in health facilities across Ghana.
            <br />
            The CRN-URD is designed to advance medical care and research on
            genetic and rare diseases by providing support for clinical and
            study sites by facilitating collaboration, study enrollment and data
            sharing. Through the CRN-URD, physicians, scientists and their
            multidisciplinary teams work together with patient advocacy groups
            to provide high standard care and study rare diseases at sites
            across the country.The CRN-URD is made up of undiagnosed, genetic
            and rare disease clinical and research groups that work together
            improving the availability of rare disease information, treatment,
            clinical studies, and general awareness for both patients and the
            medical community. <br />
            The structure of the networks varies between each site, but all
            share the common goal of providing the infrastructure to support
            high quality clinical care and research for the benefit of patients
            living with undiagnosed, genetic and rare disorders. There is a
            commitment to ensure that the clinical and research networks across
            the country work together in an integrated manner to share
            experiences, develop joint initiatives and promote partnership and
            nation-wide working wherever possible. <br />
            Our collective mission is improving the wellbeing and quality of
            lives of all those affected by congenital, undiagnosed, genetic and
            rare diseases in Ghana, including improved knowledge and awareness,
            timely diagnosis and prevention (when possible), access to best
            treatment and care (regardless of where the family lives in Ghana),
            engagement with supportive community care (volunteer patient-based
            and established resources), fair access to appropriate therapies
            based on patient needs, and support for research that builds on
            Ghanaian expertise and promotes application.
